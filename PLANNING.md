# Midterm Project LHL - January 2022 cohort 

### Team:
Stanislav Po, Chris Bell, Lindsay Tannahill

### Project Option: 
Smart To-Do 

### Requirements: 
Each todo created should be categorized as one of:
- Film / Series (To watch)
-Restaurants, cafes, etc. (To eat)
- Books (To read)
- Products (To buy)

In order to determine the category the app will probably need to use various API services such as those offered by Google, Wolfram Alpha, Rotten Tomatoes, Amazon, Yelp and others.
API services mentioned above are only suggestions. You will have to investigate how to balance the accurate categorization of items with having to deal with multiple API endpoints.
Users should be able to change a category of an item in case it was mis-categorized or could not be categorized at all.
Users should be able to register, log in, log out and update their profile.
Ajax **  Single page interface 

### Goals before next meeting:

What are our communication preferences?
Daily check ins x 2 
Update over discord when we’re working on something

### Things to consider:

- Wireframing
- APIs
- Sass/Bootstrap
- User Interface / User Experience 
- Minimum Viable Product - Only code what you’re going to show
- Don’t do user login / registration - one end point to log users in (GET) - set a cookie 
- Review Francis’ lighthouse github for all of the files that we’ll need - do we understand what they’re all for?
- Single page or multi-page ? or both ?
- Mentors still exist !
- Coolors.co
- Github - use branches - do not code on main or master - check with team before merging - come up with a specific plan for how we use Github 
- Merge conflicts 
- Splitting up the work 
- Vertically - everyone is working on a different piece of the stack (i.e. backend, database, front end) 
- Horizontally - everyone working on the same layer 
- Pair programming - working through things together - leader / writer 
- Lean into your weaknesses 
- We are reviewing the last 5 weeks of the curriculum 
- Communication 


### Smart To do List User Story
 
As a user, I want to add items to categories automatically, because doing it manually takes too much time.
As a user I want to recategorize items, because they are in the wrong category or not categorised at all.
As a user I want to be able to check off items on the list, because they are complete.
As a user I want to be able to delete items off the list, because I changed my mind.

### User Scenarios

A user scenario is a syntactic alternative to user stories
They have the form: Given __, when _, then ____.
eg. Given that I am logged in, when I click favourite on a post, then it is added to my favourites.
You can also chain on an and to user stories/scenarios
eg. Given that I am logged in, when I click favourite on a post, then it is added to my favourites and the save icon will change to indicate success.
