# The Big To-Do 

This website auto-populates to do lists by running the input thorugh an API process. By entering data, the website will sort your information into one of four categories where you can then check it off, resort it, or delete it. 

## Creators 
This website was created in February 2022 by Christopher Bell, Stanislav Plotnikov, and Lindsay Tannahill as a part of their Lighthouse Labs midterm. 

- CSS & Design by [Lindsay Tannahill](https://github.com/lbtannahill) 
- Backend and databasing by [Christopher Bell](https://github.com/CBBell99)
- Functionality and debugging by [Stanislav Plotnikov](https://github.com/Stas74)

## Features

You can edit, delete and check off items that are added to the to-do lists. The CSS was created by scratch by us based on our own wireframe design. The EAT sorting feature works best for chain restaurants. Use this app to keep track of all the things in life that you want to do!
